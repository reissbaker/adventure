    <script type=x/adventure id=ab-intro>
      You're sitting inside of a black Lincoln towncar. Your phone buzzes: a
      passenger east of here needs a ride. Since there's nothing else to do, you
      tap the accept button.
    </script>

    <script type=x/adventure id=ab-arrival>
      A few minutes later, you pull up in front of a short apartment building.
      No one is there.
    </script>

    <script type=x/adventure id=ab-call>
      No one comes.
    </script>

    <script type=x/adventure id=ab-call2>
      You wait patiently, but no one comes.
    </script>

    <script type=x/adventure id=ab-phone>
      "Hello, sir, this is your driver," you say into the phone.
      "Thanks, I'll be right down," he responds tersely.
    </script>

    <script type=x/adventure id=ab-appearance>
      An unkempt man wearing pajamas and a backpack walks leisurely down the
      front steps of the apartment building. "{{ statement }}," he says. He gets
      into the car and gives you directions to his destination. You pull out
      onto Folsom Street as he taps on his phone in the back seat.
    </script>

    <script type=x/adventure id=ab-talking>
      "Fuck, man, I just got back from Burning Man and it was fucking
      revelatory," he says, continuing to tap on his phone. You're not sure if
      he's talking to you. "Money, man, it fucks with you. It's dehumanizing.
      There are better ways of exchanging value, you know?" He pauses and looks
      into the mirror, making clear that he was, apparently, addressing you all
      along. "Fuck capitalism," he says, emphatically.
    </script>

    <script type=x/adventure id=ab-destination>
      The rest of the ride continues in silence, punctuated only by faint taps
      of skin on Corning glass. Eventually you arrive at your destination. The
      man steps out of the car. "Thanks man, it was great talking to you," he
      says.
    </script>

    <script type=x/adventure id=ab-end>
      A few minutes later, you receive an alert on your phone. Your passenger
      rated their drive {{ score }}/5 stars.
