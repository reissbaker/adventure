# Adventure

An adventure game. Play it at
[reissbaker.github.io/adventure](http://reissbaker.github.io/adventure).


# Hack On It

First install [`node`](http://nodejs.org), which comes bundled with the `npm`
executable. Then run:

```bash
chmod +x script/server
./script/server $SOME_PORT
```

Where `$SOME_PORT` is a port you have available. If you're not sure, `8000`
will do.

And preemptive apologies for the hacks and poor standards. I HAD A DEADLINE TO
MEET.
